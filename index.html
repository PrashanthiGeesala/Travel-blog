    <h2>What Makes Andaman An Amazing Tourist Destination </h2>
    <p>Sparsely-populated beaches that give way to an ocean brimming with interesting marine life and coral gardens are just one of the reasons to visit the beautiful Andaman
      and Nicobar Islands. Ghandi Park, Sippighat Farm and the century-old Cellular Jail (now a pilgrimage destination) provide glimpses into the past and present of these peaceful islands with a mysterious and multicultural past. Despite of the
      horrid reputation during the colonial period, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands this day are one of the most sought after tourist destination of India. The islands are famous for its serene, white sandy beaches characterized by sparkling blue
      waters.
